### Sample Python Implementation Outline with Threading for Real-Time Simulation

In this directory is a Python example where each RelayNode operates as an independent thread. Each node dynamically assesses its connections and decides on message forwarding based on simulated link availability and priority.

Explanation of Key Functionalities

    Threaded Nodes:
        Each RelayNode operates as an independent thread, continuously attempting to forward messages at intervals to simulate real-time activity.

    Dynamic Link Availability:
        Each forward_message attempt randomly decides if a connection is available, reflecting real-life disruptions like signal loss or occlusion due to planetary bodies.

    Retry and Prioritization Mechanisms:
        Messages are sorted by priority, and high-priority messages are forwarded first.
        Each message has a limited number of retry attempts, allowing nodes to prioritize newer messages if older ones fail repeatedly.

    Energy Conservation:
        Randomized message-forwarding intervals (time.sleep(random.uniform(1, 3))) mimic energy-saving operations by spacing out attempts, akin to actual relay nodes optimizing energy in space.

### Real-World Relevance

This model is aligned with real-world systems such as NASA’s Deep Space Network (DSN) and Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) in its use of autonomous nodes and dynamic route selection to manage latency and minimize retransmissions in deep-space communications​

This simulation could be expanded further with:

    Adaptive routing: Use machine learning to predict the best routes based on historical data.
    Energy-aware scheduling: Integrate power-saving features based on simulated battery levels.

This system could effectively manage communication for networks of interplanetary probes, lunar outposts, and other space-based assets, supporting high-latency and high-disruption environments.

### Running the simulation

Key Comments and Explanation

    Class-Level Docstrings:
        Added detailed docstrings for SpaceRelayMessage and RelayNode to describe attributes and methods, explaining the purpose of each class.

    Comments in RelayNode Methods:
        add_connection: Adds a new connection to a neighboring node, enabling routing between nodes.
        receive_message: Checks if the message is already stored to avoid duplicates and stores new messages.
        forward_message: Attempts to send stored messages to connected nodes, retrying on link failures and giving up after a set maximum number of attempts.
        run: Main loop to forward messages periodically, simulating autonomous, ongoing node operation.
        stop: Method to end the thread loop, allowing controlled shutdown.

    Simulated Link Availability:
        The random.choice([True, False]) in forward_message represents unpredictable space link availability, introducing realistic disruptions and retries.
