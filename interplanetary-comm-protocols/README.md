# Interplanetary Communication Protocols

This project explores and prototypes communication systems for interplanetary missions. The focus is on designing protocols for reliable, autonomous communication in deep space, where traditional communication infrastructures like the internet are unavailable.

## Key Components:
- Range Check Protocol
- Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN)
- Message Routing and Store-and-Forward Systems
- Handling Latency and Ephemeris Data

## Getting Started
To get started, explore the `src/` directory, where each protocol is implemented and documented.

## Documentation
To read more, explore the `docs/` directory, where the protocols are documented in detail.
