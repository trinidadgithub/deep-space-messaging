## Range Check Protocol and Light Burst Broadcast System
### Overview

The Range Check Protocol and Light Burst Broadcast System are critical components of the interplanetary communication architecture. These protocols ensure precise and reliable communication between starships, satellites, and ground bases using laser-based communication. They account for the challenges of deep-space communication, such as line-of-sight requirements, dynamic movement of nodes, and intermittent connectivity.

### Why Traditional Radio Wave Communication is Obsolete for Deep Space Communication
1. **Insufficient Data Bandwidth**

    Radio waves offer limited bandwidth, which makes them inefficient for transmitting the large amounts of data needed for modern space missions (e.g., high-resolution images, telemetry, video streams).
    As space missions become more complex (e.g., human missions to Mars or interplanetary probes), the data demands far exceed the capacity of radio communication systems.

2. **Signal Dispersion and Power Loss**

    Radio waves disperse over long distances, causing significant signal degradation by the time they reach their target. This leads to:
        Lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver.
        The need for high transmission power, which is impractical for deep-space systems with limited energy supplies.

3. **Latency Constraints and Long Transmission Times**

    Radio waves travel at the speed of light, but over vast interplanetary distances, this results in significant latency:
        It takes over 20 minutes for a signal to travel one way between Earth and Mars at their furthest distance.
        Traditional radio systems can't compensate for this communication delay effectively, requiring more advanced protocols to handle long latencies.

4. **Interference and Spectrum Crowding**

    The radio frequency spectrum is highly crowded due to widespread use on Earth (satellites, military, commercial, etc.).
    In deep space, solar radiation and cosmic background noise introduce interference, further degrading radio communication.
    Future missions will require dedicated communication channels free from interference, which lasers can provide.

5. **Laser Communication as a Superior Alternative**

    Laser-based communication offers higher bandwidth with tighter beams and much less signal dispersion over long distances.
    Line-of-sight laser links reduce the risk of interference, making them ideal for interplanetary communication.
    Lower power requirements: Lasers can transmit data more efficiently, reducing the energy needed on spacecraft and satellites.
    Security and precision: Narrow laser beams are harder to intercept, providing increased data security compared to radio waves.


As space missions demand higher data rates, greater reliability, and efficient power usage, laser-based communication has emerged as the preferred technology. Traditional radio wave communication is now considered obsolete for long-distance interplanetary communication due to its limitations in bandwidth, interference management, and power efficiency.
### Objective

The Range Check Protocol ensures that:

- Nodes can only communicate when they are within range.
- Line-of-sight (LOS) between nodes is clear.
- Laser transmitters and receivers are aligned before transmission.
- Messages are stored and forwarded if communication isn't immediately possible.

Steps of the Range Check Protocol

    Node Discovery and Initialization:
        Nodes broadcast their position, velocity, and status periodically.
        Each node uses this data to determine whether communication is possible.

    Calculate Distance Between Nodes:

        The distance between two nodes is calculated using the Euclidean formula:
The distance between two nodes is calculated using the **Euclidean formula**:

\[
\text{distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}
\]


Line-of-Sight (LOS) Check:

    Ensures that no obstacles (e.g., other objects or terrain) block the communication path between nodes.

Align Laser Transmitters:

    The node calculates the angle required to align the laser transmitter with the receiver.
    Laser alignment ensures focused signal transmission to the target.

Verify Communication Range:

    If the calculated distance is within range, the message is sent; otherwise, it is queued for later transmission.

Store-and-Forward Mechanism:

    If the target node is out of range, the message is stored locally and retried when the node comes back within range.

Periodic Retries:

    Nodes retry communication at defined intervals if the target node is out of range or the initial transmission fails.
